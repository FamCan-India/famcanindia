<h2>About FamCan-India</h2>

<section>
    <h3>Project Background</h3>
    <p>The FamCan-India registry was established to address a critical gap in India’s cancer research landscape: the absence of a dedicated familial cancer registry. While population-based and hospital-based registries exist, none systematically capture hereditary cancer patterns across families. FamCan-India was created to fill this void, enabling early detection, precision medicine, and evidence-based public health planning.
	The project began in November 2021 as a major research initiative funded by Nirma University, with its foundation laid at the Institute of Science, Nirma University. Subsequent development has been carried forward at the Drs. Kiran & Pallavi Patel Global University (KPGU), Vadodara, strengthening its scientific and technical framework. The pilot study has drawn primarily from Gujarat, with contributions from major hospitals including Kailash Cancer Hospital and Research Centre (KCHRC), Goraj and Hemato-Oncology Clinic (HOC Vedanta), Ahmedabad, alongside community-reported cases through word of mouth.
	Unlike traditional PBCRs or HBCRs, FamCan-India integrates internal hospital databases and family-linked records, creating a schema-driven system that connects families, individuals, and genetic variants. The registry is designed for pan-India expansion, welcoming collaborations from hospitals, research centers, and clinicians nationwide to enrich familial cancer entries.
	The project’s primary focus is on early detection of hereditary cancers, tracking familial cancer incidence rates across India, and augmenting precision medicine research through bioinformatics and genetic insights. All data handling follows the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) National Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical and Health Research Involving Human Participants (2017, updated 2023), ensuring informed consent, confidentiality, and responsible use of sensitive genetic and familial information under the oversight of institutional ethics committees.

    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>
        The mission of FamCan-India is to establish a comprehensive, pan-India familial cancer registry that bridges critical gaps in research and clinical practice. By systematically documenting hereditary cancer patterns across families, the registry empowers early detection, strengthens precision medicine, and supports evidence-based public health strategies. Guided by ethical standards and collaborative partnerships, FamCan-India strives to protect families while advancing scientific knowledge.

    <h3>Our Goals</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Build a national registry: Integrate familial cancer data from hospitals, research centers, and communities across India.</li>
        <li>Enable early detection: Identify hereditary cancer risks at the family level to improve prevention and timely intervention.</li>
        <li>Track incidence rates: Generate reliable statistics on familial cancer prevalence across diverse regions and populations.</li>
        <li>Advance precision medicine: Provide a structured dataset for bioinformatics-driven research in cancer genetics and personalized care.</li>
        <li>Foster collaboration: Encourage partnerships with hospitals, universities, and clinicians nationwide to expand registry coverage.</li>
        <li>Ensure ethical data use: Uphold ICMR’s national ethical guidelines, maintaining confidentiality, informed consent, and responsible handling of sensitive information.</li>
        <li>Support policy and awareness: Deliver insights that inform public health policy, patient advocacy, and community education.</li>
    </ul>
