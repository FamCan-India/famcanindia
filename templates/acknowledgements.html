        <h4>Dr. Sonal Rajiv Bakshi - Principal Investigator and Scientific Advisor</h4>
        <p>
            She conceived the idea of FamCan-India and has provided scientific leadership throughout its development. 
            She has a Ph.D. on cytogenetics of neoplasia from Gujarat University. She is a retired Assistant Professor 
             at Institute of Science, Nirma University and former Research Scientist at Gujarat Cancer & 
            Research Institute, Ahmedabad. With over two decades of experience in human cytogenetics and cancer genetics, 
            she pioneered advanced cytogenetic techniques in Gujarat and has mentored numerous researchers. 
            Her vision transformed a research gap into a national initiative, ensuring that hereditary cancer patterns 
            are systematically documented for the first time in India.
