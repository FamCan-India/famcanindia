    <h2>Welcome to FamCan-India</h2>
    <p>
        FamCan-India is a national familial cancer registry designed to support research, clinical insight, 
        and public health planning across India. Our mission is to systematically document and analyze inherited 
        cancer patterns, enabling early detection, personalized care, and evidence-based policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike traditional registries that focus only on individual cases, FamCan-India is built on a 
        <strong>region-wise classification and structured data architecture</strong> that connects families, 
        individuals, and genetic variants into a unified framework. By harmonizing data from diverse sources, 
        the registry provides a <strong>pan-India view of hereditary cancer</strong>, capturing both clinical 
        and genetic dimensions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead of simply aggregating Population-Based Cancer Registries (PBCRs) and Hospital-Based Cancer Registries (HBCRs), 
        FamCan-India goes further:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>It integrates clinical records, family histories, and genetic variant data into a single platform.</li>
        <li>It ensures cross-linkages between hospitals, research centers, and community networks, so familial cancer cases are not siloed but connected across regions.</li>
        <li>It transforms fragmented datasets into a comprehensive national resource, enabling researchers and clinicians to trace hereditary cancer trends across generations and geographies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This expanded scope makes FamCan-India not just a registry, but a <strong>collaborative infrastructure for precision medicine in India</strong>.
